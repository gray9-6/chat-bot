# chat-bot

In this project i am integrating open ai url with springboot , so that i can communicate with chat gpt , through my application

Authentication :-
From any application, if you want to talk to the chat gpt , chat gpt wil give you a secret key , you can use that key as a authentication, 
or you can use that as a token while invoking any api from chat-gpt
